## Content 
This repository come along with the paper <i>Structuring Uncertainty for Fine-Grained Sampling in Stochastic Segmentation Networks</i>, published at <i>Neurips 2022</i>.
Specifically, the repository contains the following components:
* <u>Prepare Models</u> <br> Contains everything what needs to be done before the predicted factors can be rotated, i.e., the training and evaluation procedure of different stochastic segmentation models (for details see below). 
* <u>Factor Rotations</u> <br> This folder contains everything related to the factor rotations, i.e., the rotation script and different metrics to evaluate single rotations and reproduce the results from the paper. 
* <u>Demo</u> <br> Contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the proposed approach. The folder also contains 5 example images for exploring the approach.

# Working with this repository
### Pre-requirements
This repository has been tested under ```Python 3.7``` in a *unix* development environment. <br> 
For a setup, clone the repository and ``cd``to the root of it. <br>
Create a new environment and activate it, for instance, on unix via
```
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
```
Then install the needed packages via:
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Getting started with examples
To get a first impression of the approach, we offer a demo jupyter notebook located in ```./Demo/``` (a quick demo video for fine-grained sampling is found in the file 'finegrainedsampling_demo.avi', see also above.
We prepared some test images for usage in this notebook (with pre-computed rotations). 
The notebook can be run within your browser. Use the command ```jupyter notebook``` and navigate in the browser to ```Demo/demo.ipynb```)

## Reproduction of the results presented in the paper
The following visualization gives an overview of the components contained in this repository that are needed for the *prediction, rotation and evaluation* of different representations of predicted factor models.

In more detail, the following steps can be undertaken to reproduce the results from the paper:
1) Train the SSNs (see below)
2) Evaluate test images using trained SSNs. The predicted factor model parameters are saved into a Pickle file stored in the corresponding subfolder of ```./Results/```
3) Compute the rotations. The rotation files are also stored in the pkl-file. 
4) Visualize and manipulate rotated factors using the gui provided with the Jupyter Notebook ```./Demo/demo.ipynb```

In the following, we describe these steps in more detail.

### Train a Stochastic Segmentation Network
Training pipelines for the *LIDC* [1,2,3], the *SEN12MS* [5], and the *CamVid* dataset are pre-implemented. <br><br>
The main steps needed for the training process are similar for all three data sets. <br><br>

Exemplarily, for the SEN12MS dataset, the steps would be the following:
1) Download the data as stated below.
2) Setup the experiment configuration, the configuration used in the publication is given in the available config files.
3) Start the training with the path to the experiment configuration as parameter: <br>
```python ./PrepareModels/train_SEN12MS.py --config ./PrepareModels/Config_SEN12MS.yml```
The training scripts automatically build an experiment ```./Results/<experiment_name>/<experiment_folder>``` and place a copy of the configuration file there. 

### Evaluation of trained networks and saving of the predicted factor models
In this part, the predictive performance of the trained networks can be evaluated on the test split of the corresponding data set. **Further, for each test data sample/image, a pickle file is saved**. These pickle files contain information about the predicted uncertainty, as for example the predicted *mean*, *low-rank covariance factor*, and the *diagonal* of the predicted factor model. <br>

The evaluation process can be started similarly for all three data sets, with an experiment folder as parameter. For example, for the SEN12MS dataset it is:<br>
```python ./PrepareModels/eval_SEN12MS.py --experiment_folder <path_to_exp_folder>``` <br><br>
For saving the pickle files, a folder structure is created within the experiment folder: ```<experiment_folder>/results/pkls```. 

### Compute Rotations
Different rotations can be computed using ```./FactorRotations/PreComputeRotations.py```:<br><br>
```python ./FactorRotations/PreComputeRotations.py --pkl_source <path_to_pkl_source> --rotation <rotation> --no_reps <no_reps>```
* *pkl_source* - is either the path to a single pickle-file or a folder containing multiple pickle files.
* *rotation* - 'all' for all rotations or one of 'varimax', 'fpvarimax', 'equamax', 'fpequamax', 'quartimax', 'fpquartimax'.
* *no_reps* - number of repetions/restarts, default: 1.

### Evaluate Rotations
The computed rotations can be evaluated individually using ```./FactorRotations/EvalRotatedFactors.py```:<br><br>
```python ./FactorRotations/EvalRotatedFactors.py --pkl_source <path_to_pkl_source>```
* *pkl_source* - is either the path to a single pickle-file or a folder containing multiple pickle files.<br><br>

The results of multiple files can be summarized and plotted using ```./FactorRotations/PrintRotationResults.py```:<br><br>
```python ./FactorRotations/PrintRotationResults.py --pkl_source <path_to_pkl_source>```
* *pkl_source* - a folder containing multiple pickle files with evaluated rotations.<br><br>

### Demo
For a visual evaluation of the rotations, the demo notebook placed in ```./Demo/``` can be used. It loads pickle files containing different rotations, computed as described above. We deliver some example files with pre-computed rotations that are located in ```./Demo/Examples/```. In order to load your own files, the root path within the demo can be adjusted.
